            <span class="reference">By Robert Frost</span><br>
            <p>
                Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>
                And sorry I could not travel both<br>
                And be one traveler, long I stood<br>
                And looked down one as far as I could<br>
                To where it bent in the undergrowth;<br>
            </p>
            <p> 
                Then took the other, as just as fair,<br>
                And having perhaps the better claim,<br>
                Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br>
                Though as for that the passing there<br>
                Had worn them really about the same,<br>
            </p>
            <p> 
                And both that morning equally lay<br>
                In leaves no step had trodden black.<br>
                Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br>
                Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br> 
                I doubted if I should ever come back.<br>
            </p>
            <p> 
                I shall be telling this with a sigh<br>
                Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br>
                Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”<br>
                I took the one less traveled by,<br>
                And that has made all the difference.<br>
            </p>
