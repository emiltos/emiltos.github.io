                <img src="img/sideimage.jpg" class="img_side" alt="Image of a man running">Running is the safest, healthiest, and most accessible sport in the United States. It is considered a cardiovascular (aerobic) exercise that can improve people's stamina, bone density, leg muscles and can even expand an individual's life expectancy. Running does not only improve an individuals physical health but mental health as well. The exercise is recorded to have begun 2.6 million years ago, with the initial purpose of early humans hunting for animals.

                Through the centuries of BCE, religious festivals and competitions began to host and include races of people running against one another. 623 BCE was the earliest recorded date when the first race occurred in a religious festival in Ireland. Meanwhile, in 776 BCE, the first Olympic games took place in Greece with the first 200-meter dash. During those centuries, races also took place in the continents of Africa and Asia, and exercise began to form into a sports part of our human and athletic culture.

                There are three main athletic sports that involve the exercise of running: cross country, track and field, and road running.In 1883, Cross Country became a community-based sport for running. The sport involves a group or individuals running through natural lands such as grasslands, mud, forests, hills, and flat grounds such as parks, sidewalks, or roads. The sport is active during the fall and winter seasons. Cross-country runners (nicknamed to be harriers) are categorized and placed in races between close and similar age groups and gender. The most common race miles are the 1 mile, 2 mile, 5k, 10k, and 15k. Meets, competitions, and invitationals are where certain cross-country clubs, schools, and organizations gather to compete against one another.

                Track and Field is another running sport but involving both short and long-distance races. Short-distance races include the 60, 100, 200, 400-meter dash. Long-distance races include the 800, 1500, 3000, 5000, and 10000 meter races. Certain races such as the 4x100 and 4x400 meter dash, include hurdles and batons. School teams, clubs, and organizations are also involved in the sport, with local and even national and international competitions taking place for professional athletes.

                As for Road Running, this sport is a long-distance run with the common distances for a race being 5k, 10k, 15k, half-marathons, and full marathons. The race usually takes place on flat grounds such as town or major city streets. the races are open to the public, anyone can join by paying a fee to the organization or charity involved with developing and hosting the race. people are also separated into categories based on their gender and age group but most races allow both genders and runners (average or professional) to participate in the race.

                 Items used for most of these running sports include vests, singlets, running shoes, spikes, fanny packs, and numbered bibs. spikes are lighter-weight running shoes with metal spikes underneath them. The spikes are known as teeth and their purpose is to get an extra grip and boost from any soil or uneven terrain such as grass, mud, and hills. It also helps with running faster and avoiding any slips or trips, especially when on the track. Meanwhile, running shoes are used for any ground surface but most of the time for cross country and road running, it is used for paved surfaces and also dirt and grass lands.

                 Running bids are a very important item while running a race, as it track youâ€™re race time after crossing the finish line. The number includes the runner's race record. Once the runners cross the finish line, organizers or volunteers write down their record time. But, there is a new and innovative bid created and used, called RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) which is placed on the race bib and even on a shoe chip tied on the shoelace. A timing mat is placed on the finish line automatically recording the runner's race time from the RFID.

                Running has a remarkable way of bringing communities together, offering a mix of enjoyment, humanitarian causes, self-discipline, and improved wellness. But what truly sets it apart is the personal challenge it presents as running is not just about competing with others. It's about surpassing our own boundaries, constantly striving to beat our own records and push ourselves further.
